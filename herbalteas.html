    <h2>Herbal Teas</h2>
    <h4>Echinacea tea</h4>
    <img src="/Assets/css/gallery/Echinacea Tea.jpeg" id="herbaltes">
    <p class="text-align2">Echinacea tea is an extremely popular remedy that’s said to prevent and shorten the common cold.

        Evidence has shown that echinacea may help boost the immune system, which could help the body fight off viruses or infections .
        Many studies have found that echinacea can shorten the duration of the common cold, lessen the severity of its symptoms or even prevent it .
        
        However, results are conflicting, and most studies have not been well designed. This makes it difficult to tell if positive results are due to echinacea or random chance.
         Therefore, it’s not possible to say definitively that taking echinacea will help with the common cold.
        
        At the very least, this warm herbal drink may help soothe your sore throat or clear up your stuffy nose if you do feel a cold coming on.</p>

        <h4>Peppermint Tea</h4>
        <img src="/Assets/css/gallery/peppermint tea.jpg" id="herbaltes">
        <p class="text-align2">Peppermint tea is one of the most commonly used herbal teas in the world.

            While it’s most popularly used to support digestive tract health, it also has antioxidant, anticancer, antibacterial and antiviral properties.
            Most of these effects have not been studied in humans, so it’s not possible to know if they might lead to health benefits. However, several studies have confirmed peppermint’s beneficial effects on the digestive tract.
            
            Several studies have shown that preparations of peppermint oil, which often included other herbs as well, can help relieve indigestion, nausea and stomach pain.
            Evidence also shows that peppermint oil is effective at relaxing spasms in the intestines, esophagus and colon.
            
            Lastly, studies have repeatedly found that peppermint oil is effective at relieving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.
            Therefore, when you experience digestive discomfort, whether it be from cramping, nausea or indigestion, peppermint tea is a great natural remedy to try.</p>

            <h4>Rose Hip Tea</h4>
        <img src="/Assets/css/gallery/rosehip tea.jpg" id="herbaltes">
        <p class="text-align2">Rose hip tea is made from the fruit of the rose plant. 
           It is high in vitamin C and beneficial plant compounds. These plant compounds, in addition to certain fats found in rose hips, result in anti-inflammatory properties .
            
           Several studies have looked into the ability of rose hip powder to reduce inflammation in people with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
           Many of these studies found it effective at reducing inflammation and its related symptoms, including pain .
            
           Rose hips may also be beneficial for weight management, as one 12-week study in 32 overweight people found that taking rose hip extract resulted in decreased BMI and belly fat.
           Rose hip’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects may also help fight skin aging.
            
           One preliminary study found that taking rose hip powder for eight weeks reduced the depth of wrinkles around the eyes and improved moisture and skin elasticity of the face.
           These properties may result in other health benefits as well, though more studies will be needed to confirm these effects and investigate any new ones.</p>
