# Bugs

I encountered a few bugs while trying to deploy the Media Queries for different sections of the site.
Some Queries would stick with a particular page size. i.e. media queries for Tablets where:( @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) )
would remain even after going back and checking all the CSS styles.

I rectified this by making sure brackets were correct in code and closed.

# Deployment
In order to deploy site to Github I had to do the following:
• Select Settings at top of Repository page.
